*pluginstats.txt*   Provide statistics how often a source file was loaded
                    Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com

Downloading & installing plugins is easy. Not all of them turn out to be 
of actual use and you forget about them. This plugins helps you identify 
plugins you have installed but do not actually use that often to justify 
cluttering your 'runtimepath' and thus slowing down startup time. Simply 
make sure this plugin is loaded on startup. After a few days, use the 
|:Pluginstats| command to check which script files were loaded how 
often. The number of times autoload files were loaded will give you a 
hint, which plugins you actually used.

Features:
    - The |:Pluginstats| command displays script use in CSV format.
    - If |g:pluginstats_autoexport| is greater than zero, the statistics 
      are exported automatically every N days.
